Usage: dns-tcp2udp <dest ip> <listen ip> [listen ip]...

Accepts TCP connections from one or more <listen ip> and forwards them using
UDP to <dest ip>.

Incoming connections have the read/write buffers set to large enough to
process a single DNS packet but no more. If there has been no UDP reponse
for 30 seconds the connection is closed. Each TCP socket connection creates
a separate UDP socket connection so that replies (should) go to the correct
client.

Changes to UID/GID 65534 before forking.
